# The Pregnancy App

**As seen on some tweet i found on reddit, i decided to make this app real and enjoy learning kivymd and also making something fun to share**

**Things i used in this project**

1. Python 3.8
2. [Kivymd](https://github.com/kivymd/KivyMD.git) framework which is more elegant and neat looking for developing cross-platform mobile apps

**This app was my own fun way to learn the framework and not a production material**
